# HarvardX Problem Sets - Python & C

This repository contains solutions to problem sets completed as part of HarvardX's CS50 series on edX. These assignments, originally written in Python and C, demonstrate my understanding of foundational programming concepts and serve as a reference for my current university coursework in C++.

## Overview

- **Languages**: Python and C
- **Platform**: edX (HarvardX CS50 series)
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Basic algorithms and data structures
  - Memory management and pointers (C)
  - File I/O and error handling
  - Problem-solving and logical thinking
  - User experience design considerations

## Purpose

These solutions are shared as a personal reference for further coursework in computer science, particularly for my C++ assignments in university. They provide a foundation in programming practices and problem-solving strategies applicable to other languages.

> **Note**: All code is original and adheres to the academic integrity guidelines of both HarvardX and my current institution. These solutions are not meant for direct reuse but as a learning and comparison resource for advancing my C++ skills.
